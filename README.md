# Swim Board

Before I was a bootcamp student, "hobby coding" on my own, I used to go to swim class at the YMCA. Our swim instructor wanted to turn the white board hanging on the wall into an app that people could keep track of their swim distances. This Rails-React app will be an attempt to do that. I will be reusing some code from my TriTraining app (https://github.com/mntjones/tritraining).

## Application Description
This application was created for a swimmer to enter their distance daily to keep track of their progress.

A Swimmer can add a date and distance. 

A Swimmer can also view a list of their most recent 10 swims, as well as a total distance for the month.

### Future usages

A Swimmer can view 5 longest swims

A Swimmer can sort by distances
